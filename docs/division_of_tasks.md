Given our recent pivot towards deepening the contextual integration of AI/Audio and then layering Gamification on top, here's a potential work breakdown for the next ~2 sprints (roughly 4 weeks), distributing the load across you (Partner/Lead?), Dev 2, Dev 3, and Dev 4:

Sprint Goal 1 & 2: Fully integrate AI/Audio contextually within the learning flow, bring the Gamification system fully online (UI + Backend Hooks), and enhance core subject/learning UI.

Proposed Work Split (Next 2 Sprints):

Developer 1 - Gemini: (Partner/Lead? - Overseer & Core Integration/Neural Focus):
* Sprint 1:
* Contextual Audio Frontend: Finalize and test the frontend logic for suggesting/activating audio presets based on Subject/Lesson data (building on my last update).
* User Cognitive State Service (Backend): Define and implement the initial UserProgressService (or similar) to track and retrieve a user's "cognitive state" (current audio preset, recent performance). This is needed for dynamic pathing.
* Oversee & Review: Provide guidance, review PRs from the team, ensure consistency with NeuroForge patterns. Unblock others.
* (Stretch): Begin backend setup for WebSocket service for future neural feedback.
* Sprint 2:
* Neural Feedback (Phase 1 - Backend): Implement basic WebSocket server logic to receive simple behavioral metrics (e.g., time on task, click patterns from frontend) and store/process them.
* Neural Feedback (Phase 1 - Frontend): Implement frontend logic to send these basic behavioral metrics via WebSocket.
* Refine Cognitive State: Enhance the backend service based on incoming metrics.
* Continue Overseeing & Review.

Developer 2 - GPT: (Frontend Focus - Gamification & UI Polish):
* Sprint 1:
* Gamification UI - Core Displays: Implement Level/XP display (Navbar/Dashboard Progress Bar) using the /gamification/status endpoint. Implement Streak display on Dashboard.
* Gamification UI - Achievements: Build the AchievementBadge component. Implement the /achievements page to display all available (and locked/unlocked state) achievements using the /gamification/achievements & /achievements/unlocked endpoints.
* Gamification UI - Feedback: Implement toast notifications triggered by gamification data in API responses (e.g., from completeLesson, submitReview).
* Sprint 2:
* Profile Customization (UI Foundation): Build the UI elements on the profile page related to avatar/flair unlocked by achievements (data fetching TBD later).
* UI Polish: Refine animations/transitions for level ups, achievement unlocks. Improve overall dashboard layout incorporating gamification elements.
* (Stretch): Build basic Leaderboard component structure (fetching data TBD).

Developer 3 - Claude: (Full Stack Focus - Learning Flow & Content Types):
* Sprint 1:
* Subject Management UI - Drag & Drop: Implement drag-and-drop reordering on the SubjectList component (using a library like react-beautiful-dnd or similar).
* Subject Management API - Reorder: Implement the backend API endpoint (POST /subjects/reorder) and logic in subjectController/SubjectOrderingService to handle saving the manual order.
* AI Context Integration: Ensure the AiTutorInterface properly receives and utilizes detailed context (Lesson, Subject, Objectives etc.) passed down from parent learning pages.
* Sprint 2:
* New Lesson Type UI: Implement frontend components for one or two new lesson contentTypes (e.g., a PatternRecognitionExercise component or a FocusTimer component integrated with a simple text lesson).
* Lesson API Enhancement: Ensure backend Lesson model/API can handle structure for these new content types.
* (Stretch): Start implementing the frontend display of the dynamic learning path suggestion provided by the backend.

Developer 4 - Grok: (Backend Focus - AI Deep Dive & Dynamic Pathing):
* Sprint 1:
* AI Service Implementation: Fully implement the API call logic in AiApiService for at least two key providers (e.g., OpenAI & Anthropic or Azure OpenAI). Integrate secure key retrieval (e.g., using Azure Key Vault SDK).
* Dynamic Pathing API: Implement/Refine the backend API endpoint (e.g., GET /learning/path/next) that uses the SubjectOrderingService and the User Cognitive State (from Dev 1's service) to suggest the next optimal lesson/subject.
* Basic AI Feature: Implement backend logic for one specific AI feature, like generating simple multiple-choice quiz questions based on lesson text (POST /ai/generate/quiz).
* Sprint 2:
* AI Rate Limiting/Tracking: Implement robust rate limiting per user/key and basic usage tracking (e.g., token count) for cost estimation in AiApiService.
* TF.js Fallback (Foundation): Set up the basic structure/packages for potential TensorFlow.js fallback on the backend (or client if preferred strategy shifts). Implement a placeholder "fallback triggered" response.
* Enhance Dynamic Pathing: Add more sophisticated rules to the backend pathing logic based on cognitive state nuances.

**Rationale:**

- Clear Ownership: Each developer has a primary domain (Gamification UI, Subject/Lesson Flow, Core Integration/Neural, Backend AI/Pathing). 
- Parallel Progress: Allows significant advancement on multiple fronts simultaneously.
- Builds on Foundation: Directly leverages the work done on AI/Audio context and Gamification backend. 
- Manages Dependencies: Dependencies exist (e.g., Gamification UI needs backend APIs, Pathing needs User State), but they are manageable with good communication and clear API contracts defined early in Sprint 1. 
- Visible Results: Each sprint should yield tangible results users could potentially see (Gamification UI, Drag/Drop, AI quizzes, Audio suggestions).

**Communication is Key:**

- Daily Standups/Syncs: Essential to coordinate dependencies.
- Clear API Contracts: Dev 4 defines the Pathing API structure early; Backend devs define Gamification API structures early.
- Code Reviews: Absolutely critical to maintain consistency and quality across the team.
