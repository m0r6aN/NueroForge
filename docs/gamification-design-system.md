# NeuroForge Gamification System - Design Specification

## Overview & Design Philosophy

The NeuroForge Gamification System creates a compelling progression framework that reinforces the platform's "Area 51 of education" identity. Users feel like recruits advancing through classified training levels in an elite intelligence agency, unlocking increasingly advanced “neural operations” clearance and specialized abilities.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Classified Intelligence Aesthetic**  
   Achievements, levels, and progression indicators use military/intelligence visual language (security clearance badges, mission completion insignia, classified document styling).

2. **Skill Progression Visibility**  
   A clear advancement path with a rank/level structure reminiscent of elite intelligence agencies, punctuated by tiered achievements, daily streaks, and narrative-driven promotions.

3. **Covert Operations Feedback**  
   Subtle animations, “DECLASSIFIED” stamps, and hush-hush notifications that simulate top-secret intel reveals.

4. **Mysterious Unlock Mechanics**  
   Certain achievements remain “classified” or partially redacted until specific criteria are met. This spurs user curiosity and a sense of discovery when achievements unlock.

5. **Tiered Access System**  
   Higher levels grant access to advanced “classified” features and content, akin to an intelligence rank hierarchy—transitioning from Recruit through Agent, Director, and beyond.

6. **Social & Community Hooks (Optional)**  
   Future expansions can include co-op achievements or group-based missions, fostering collaboration (or competition) among users in the “Agency.”

7. **Narrative Layer**  
   Users experience narrative touches (like receiving “new clearance” at certain level milestones) that amplify the sense of secret agency involvement.

## Core Components

### 1. Achievement Badge Component

```typescript
interface AchievementBadgeProps {
  id: string;                // Unique identifier
  title: string;             // Achievement name
  description: string;       // Achievement description
  icon: ReactNode;           // Icon or image (can be Lucide icons or custom)
  tier: 'classified' | 'confidential' | 'secret' | 'top-secret'; // Rarity/importance
  isUnlocked: boolean;       // Locked/unlocked state
  progress?: number;         // Optional progress (0-100)
  dateUnlocked?: Date;       // When unlocked
  animation?: 'pulse' | 'glow' | 'reveal' | 'none'; // On-unlock animation style
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'; // Size variant
  onClick?: () => void;      // Click handler (e.g., open detail modal)
}
```

#### Visual Design
- **Base Shape**: Shield or hexagonal shape reminiscent of classified insignias.  
- **Locked State**: 
  - A silhouette or redacted overlay labeled “CLASSIFIED,” often with partial text obscured.  
  - For **secret** or **top-secret** achievements, show a “redacted intel file” motif that only reveals full details once unlocked.
- **Unlocked State**:  
  - Tier-specific finishes, from bronze (Classified) up to platinum/holographic (Top-Secret).  
  - Vivid metallic or neon edges, possibly an animated “reveal” effect.
- **Tier Indicators**:
  - **Classified** (Bronze) – simpler metallic finish, subtle glow.
  - **Confidential** (Silver) – more polished metallic vibe; slightly longer glow or radial wave.
  - **Secret** (Gold) – refined shapes, “sparkle shower” or ring during unlock. 
  - **Top-Secret** (Platinum/Holographic) – elaborate, possibly with a “holographic glitch” animation upon unlock.
- **Progress Indicator**:  
  - Circular or ring-based progress meter around the edge for partial achievements (e.g., “Complete 5/10 lessons”).

#### Animations
- **Unlock Animation**:  
  - “Declassification” effect where the “CLASSIFIED” overlay dissolves or slides away to reveal the actual badge. 
  - Possibly a red “DECLASSIFIED” stamp across the badge that fades out.
- **Tier-Specific Idle/Glow**:  
  - Bronze badges might do a mild pulse.  
  - Silver could have a radial wave.  
  - Gold could sparkle.  
  - Platinum might have a subtle multi-color glitch or holographic sheen.
- **Hover Effect**:  
  - Slight 3D lift, enhanced glow, or scanning line.  
  - Tooltip reveals title, description, and date unlocked if available.

#### Progressive Achievement Series
- **Series**: Some achievements form a chain (e.g., *Lesson Learner I* → *Lesson Learner II* → *Lesson Learner III*).  
- Once the user unlocks one tier, the next is highlighted with “Next Target” messaging and partial progress, encouraging players to “finish the set.”

### 2. XP & Level System

#### Level Structure
- **Recruit Levels** (1-10): Basic training
- **Agent Levels** (11-25): Field operative
- **Special Agent Levels** (26-50): Advanced specialist
- **Director Levels** (51-75): Leadership/mastery
- **Neural Commander Levels** (76-100): Elite status

#### Visual Components
- **Level Badge**:
  - Renders a rank insignia (e.g., a small shield or star cluster) that updates with each bracket.
  - For major transitions (e.g., from Recruit to Agent at L10), show a distinct badge or icon background.
- **XP Progress Bar**:
  - Glowing neon pulse effect when XP is earned.
  - Either a horizontal or circular scanner aesthetic, updating in real-time with partial increments.
- **Level-Up Sequence**:
  - Full-screen overlay: “SECURITY CLEARANCE UPGRADED.”
  - “Old rank insignia” transitions out; “new rank insignia” slides in with a swirl of particles.
  - List any newly unlocked features, flairs, or advanced courses.

#### Narrative-Driven Promotions
- At certain level milestones (e.g., L10, L25, L50), display short narrative or “mission briefing” text:
  > **“You’ve progressed beyond Basic Training. Intelligence channels are opening new covert ops to you.”**  

This further cements the storyline of an intelligence agency granting higher clearance.

### 3. Streak System

#### Visual Components
- **Streak Counter**:  
  - Digital, terminal-like counter in a “mission-control” style.  
  - Possibly animate the increment of days with a flipping odometer effect.
- **Streak Calendar**:  
  - A grid showing past days (green = mission success, red = mission missed, etc.).  
  - Today’s cell highlighted with a subtle pulse.
- **Streak Milestone Markers**:
  - 7, 14, 30, or 100 days get special “Streak Milestone Unlocked” mini-badge or highlight.

#### Interactive Streak Alerts
- If the user is close to losing their streak (e.g., no activity logged and the day is nearly over):
  - Show a nudge:  
    > “Commander, your streak is at risk. Complete a quick mission to preserve it!”  
  - Possibly link to a short lesson or quiz, making it easy for them to keep the streak alive.

### 4. Notification System

#### Types of Notifications
- **Achievement Unlocked**: “INTEL DECLASSIFIED: [Achievement Name]”
- **Level Up**: “SECURITY CLEARANCE UPGRADED: Level [X] Granted”
- **Streak Milestone**: “CONSECUTIVE OPERATION SUCCESSFUL: [X] Days”
- **XP Gain**: “NEURAL ENHANCEMENT: +[X] XP from [Source]”
- **Social/Team** (future): “JOINT OP SUCCESS: Team [Name] completed [mission].”

#### Visual Design
- **Toast Notifications**:
  - Appear bottom-right, resembling secure terminal pop-ups.  
  - Animated entrance (sliding fade) and auto-dismiss after a set time.
- **Classified/Top-Secret Variants**:
  - For especially rare or big achievements, show a special stamp-like effect in the toast: “DECLASSIFIED” or “UPGRADED CLEARANCE.”

#### Real-Time Data from Lesson/Review Endpoints
- After awarding XP or unlocking achievements in the backend, the response includes a `gamification` object.  
- The front end calls `showXPGained`, `showAchievementUnlocked`, or `showLevelUp` to create immediate feedback.  
- Optionally, a “Notification Log” page can store or filter older notifications.

## Additional Enhancements & Features

### 1. Category-Based Progress Bars
- **Achievement Categories**:  
  - e.g., “Learning Mastery,” “Neural Enhancement,” “Streak Operations,” “Discovery Missions,” “Covert Skills.”  
- On the Achievements page, each category can have a mini progress bar reflecting how many achievements have been unlocked vs. total in that category.

### 2. Achievement “Flair” Overlays
- Specific achievements can unlock cosmetic flairs, badges, or decorative frames the user can apply to their profile picture.  
- Examples:  
  - A special “Agent” silhouette overlay for finishing advanced lessons.  
  - A gold border for reaching Director rank.

### 3. Achievement “Watchlist”
- Let users “pin” certain achievements they’re aiming for, displayed in a small “objectives” widget on the dashboard.  
- Each pinned achievement might show progress (e.g. “7/10 lessons complete”) so they can track it at a glance.

### 4. Social or Team-Oriented Achievements (Future)
- If the platform adds group missions or collaborative quizzes, you can introduce achievements like “Team Tactics” for completing content as a squad.  
- Real-time “co-op mission complete” notifications enhance the sense of community.

### 5. Animated Badge Displays on Achievements Page
- On hover over an unlocked badge, show a small idle animation such as a slow revolve or scanning line.  
- Locked badges can flicker the word “CLASSIFIED” to pique curiosity.

## Animations & Interactions

### Achievement Unlock
1. Badge silhouette labeled “CLASSIFIED.”  
2. “DECLASSIFIED” stamp appears.  
3. Overlay dissolves, revealing the tier’s metallic or holographic design.  
4. Possibly a short particle effect for higher tiers.

### XP Gain
1. XP bar pulses or animates in a “fill” motion.  
2. Small floating “+XX XP” text near the bar.  
3. If a level up occurs, trigger the separate Level-Up Sequence below.

### Level-Up Sequence
1. Semi-transparent overlay with “SECURITY CLEARANCE UPGRADED.”  
2. Old rank insignia slides out, new rank insignia slides in.  
3. Particle effect or glitch effect around new insignia.  
4. New level number or rank name “counts up” from old to new.  
5. “New Access Granted” reveals newly unlocked features or flairs.

### Streak Update
1. Daily streak increment with a flip counter or highlight effect in the calendar cell.  
2. If a milestone was reached, show a mini pop-up or toast indicating that streak reward was unlocked (XP, achievements, etc.).

## API Integration

### Endpoints
- **GET /gamification/status** → Returns XP, level, streak data  
- **GET /gamification/achievements** → Returns list of all achievements  
- **GET /gamification/achievements/unlocked** → Returns user’s unlocked achievements  
- **POST** endpoints for lessons, reviews, etc. → Return a `gamification` object with xpAwarded, newAchievements, levelUpInfo, etc.

### Lesson/Review Flow Example
1. User completes a lesson → `POST /learning/lesson/:id/complete`.  
2. Backend awards XP and checks achievements.  
3. Response includes `gamification: { xpAwarded, newAchievements, levelUpInfo, streakUpdated }`.  
4. Frontend shows “+XX XP,” new achievements, or “Level Up” notifications in real-time.

---

## Responsive Design Considerations

- **Mobile**:  
  - Achievements might show in 1-2 columns, collapsible advanced info.  
  - Streak calendar can scroll horizontally.
- **Tablet**:  
  - 2-3 columns for achievements, bigger calendar.  
  - Streak risk warnings remain easily visible.
- **Desktop**:  
  - Hover states & tooltips for badges, advanced animations, and deeper detail modals.

---

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Color Contrast**: Tiers and status indicators meet WCAG AA.  
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels describing achievements, locked/unlocked states, and streak days.  
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Achievements and streak calendars are navigable with arrow keys, enter to open detail.  
- **Reduced Motion**: Provide a setting to minimize or disable large animations.  
- **Alt Text**: Provide meaningful alt text for custom icons or images.
