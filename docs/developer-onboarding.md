Excellent move, partner! Bringing in reinforcements is smart as we ramp up complexity. More brainpower for the NeuroForge collective! üß†‚ûïüß†

To ensure our new teammates slot right into the "NeuroForge Flow" and maintain the badassery levels, here's a rundown beyond the core technical specs:

**NeuroForge Developer Onboarding - Key Patterns & Styles:**

*   **1. Project Philosophy & Vibe:**
    *   **Embrace the "Area 51" Concept:** We're building elite, slightly mysterious, cutting-edge tech. This informs UI choices (sleek, perhaps with neon accents when appropriate), feature naming, and sometimes even component structure (e.g., classified-level features might have more abstraction).
    *   **Performance Matters:** Cognitive enhancement needs a snappy UI. Think about bundle sizes (Next.js features help), efficient data fetching, and optimizing rendering, especially for complex visualizations or real-time updates later.
    *   **Security First:** We handle user data, potentially sensitive cognitive metrics later, and API keys. Adhere to security best practices (use middleware, validate inputs, manage secrets properly).
    *   **Focus on the Unique:** Prioritize and polish the features that make NeuroForge unique (AI Tutor, Audio, Adaptive Paths, AR later).

*   **2. Codebase Structure (Reinforce):**
    *   **Monorepo Mindset:** Understand the clear separation but also the interaction points between `frontend` and `backend`.
    *   **Frontend (`frontend/`):** App Router (`app/`), components (`components/`), hooks (`hooks/`), API layer (`lib/api.ts`), utils (`lib/utils.ts`), styles (`styles/`), types (`types/`). Stick to this convention.
    *   **Backend (`backend/`):** Controllers, Services (crucial for business logic!), Models (Mongo/SQL), Routes, Middleware, Config, Utils. Follow this MVC-ish + Service layer pattern strictly.

*   **3. Frontend Patterns:**
    *   **Shadcn UI is King:** **Strongly prefer** using Shadcn UI components (`components/ui/`) as the base. Add new components using the Shadcn CLI (`npx shadcn-ui@latest add ...`). Customize *within* the Shadcn framework using Tailwind utility classes. This ensures visual consistency.
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** All styling should be done via Tailwind utilities. Avoid custom CSS files unless absolutely necessary for complex, non-utility-achievable styles. Use `cn()` utility from Shadcn for conditional classes.
    *   **API Interaction:** ALL frontend API calls MUST go through `lib/api.ts`. Use the established `fetchApi` helper or add new, specific, typed functions there. Don't scatter `fetch` calls randomly.
    *   **State Management:** For local component state, use `useState`. For shared complex state or cross-component logic, look for existing React Context or custom hooks (like `useBinauralBeats`, `useAiTutor`). Discuss before adding major state libraries (like Redux/Zustand) - let's evaluate the need together.
    *   **Hooks for Logic:** Encapsulate reusable UI logic, especially involving state or side effects related to a specific feature (like audio), within custom hooks (`hooks/`).
    *   **TypeScript:** Use TypeScript diligently. **Avoid `any` like the plague.** Define interfaces (`types/`) for props, API responses, and complex objects. Leverage TS for better code intelligence and fewer runtime errors.
    *   **App Router Conventions:** Understand layout nesting, server vs. client components (`"use client"`), route groups (`(app)`, `(auth)`), and loading/error states (`loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`).

*   **4. Backend Patterns:**
    *   **Service Layer:** All significant business logic (calculations, complex data manipulation, coordination between models, external API calls like AI/Payment) belongs in the `services/` directory. Controllers should be relatively thin, calling services to do the heavy lifting.
    *   **Async/Await:** Use `async/await` consistently for all asynchronous operations (DB calls, API calls).
    *   **Error Handling:** Use the custom `ApiError` class for operational errors you want to send specific messages/statuses for. Let the global `errorMiddleware` handle unexpected errors and formatting. Always `try...catch` async operations in controllers/services.
    *   **Middleware:** Use middleware (`middleware/`) for cross-cutting concerns like authentication (`protect`), authorization (`authorize`), rate limiting, and input validation (using libraries like `express-validator` could be added).
    *   **Configuration:** Load all environment variables and config settings through `config/index.js`. Don't access `process.env` directly elsewhere.
    *   **Database Interaction:** Use Mongoose for MongoDB (Cosmos DB) interactions within Models or Services. Define schemas clearly. For Azure SQL, use the established driver (`mssql` or alternative) and structure queries logically (potentially abstracting common queries in a repository pattern later if needed).

*   **5. General Best Practices:**
    *   **Naming Conventions:** Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, components, files (e.g., PascalCase for components/classes, camelCase for variables/functions).
    *   **Modularity:** Keep components and functions focused on a single responsibility.
    *   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Look for opportunities to create reusable utils, hooks, or service functions. *Check if a utility/component already exists before creating a new one.*
    *   **Code Comments & JSDoc:** Add comments for complex logic. Use JSDoc (`/** ... */`) for functions, hooks, and complex types to explain purpose, params, and return values (as seen in recent updates). This helps with discoverability and usage.
    *   **Git Workflow:** Follow standard practices (feature branches, descriptive commit messages, pull requests for review - assuming a team workflow).
    *   **`README.md` is Truth:** Keep the setup and core commands in `README.md` up-to-date.

**Essential First Steps for New Devs:**

1.  Thoroughly read the `README.md` and the Project Specs doc.
2.  Clone the repo.
3.  Set up BOTH `frontend/.env.local` and `backend/.env` from the examples. Ensure they have *at least* the necessary keys for local DB connections (if applicable, or point to shared dev instances), JWT secret, and NextAuth secrets/providers.
4.  Run `npm install` (or yarn/pnpm) in BOTH `frontend` and `backend`.
5.  Start BOTH frontend and backend dev servers (`npm run dev`).
6.  Browse the application locally, log in, explore features.
7.  **CRITICALLY:** Spend time exploring the existing codebase structure, paying attention to `/components/ui`, `/lib/api.ts`, `/hooks` (frontend) and `/services`, `/controllers`, `/models` (backend).
8.  Look at a few recent Pull Requests (if available) to see how features were implemented.
9.  **Start Small:** Their first task should be relatively contained (e.g., add a new field to a profile settings page, implement a specific achievement trigger in the backend service, build a simple display component using Shadcn).

By emphasizing these patterns and the "NeuroForge way," we can ensure the codebase stays consistent, high-quality, and that everyone is contributing effectively to this legendary build! Let's welcome them aboard! üöÄü§ù
